## The journey of AI
  - Evolves form a single technology to broad spectrum of capabilities
  - Pattern recognition and decision prediction 

## Classical / Predictive AI (ML) vs. Generative AI vs. Agentic AI

- Classical / Predictive AI (ML)
  - Core capability: Pattern recognition and decision prediction
  - I/O - Historical data -> prediction, classification
  - Examples - Fraud detection, credit scoring, recommendation engines
  - Limitations - Needs labeled data, limited adaptability
- Generative AI
  - Core capability - Generating content (Text, images, code)
  - I/o - Prompt + generated output
  - Human Involvement: Medium, guided by propmts
  - Examples: chatgpt, Stable Diffusion, github copilot
  - Limitations: Prone to hallucinations, lacks reasoning
- Agentic AI
  - Core capability: Autonomous reasoning, planning and action
    - Degree of autonomy may vary
  - I/O: Goal/task -> Multi step execution
  - Human Involvement: Low, makes autonomous decisions
  - Examples: End to end travel booking, automated compliance, workflow orchestration
  - Limitations: Early stage, control and safety is complex

## Significance of Agentic AI
  - Beyond prediction and content
  - Need for autonomy
    - Automates multi-step workflows
    - Enhances decision-making with context
  - Bridging gaps
    - Scales operations without proportional staffing
    - Frees humans for creative and strategic work
    
- Definition
  - Agentic AI is an artificial intelligence system that can accomplish a specific goal
with limited supervision. 

## Agentic AI system properties and Advantages
  - Autonomy - acts independently without continous human guidance
  - Goal-oriented - makes informs decisions through reasoning and learning
  - Multi-tool use
  - Adaptive
  - Executes tasks across systems to achieve goals

## Business Relevance of Agentic AI
  - Delivers Transformative Capabilities Across the Enterprise
    - Efficiency - Automates complex, multi step workflows, speeding processes
    - Decision support - adds reasoning and context for better strategic decisions
    - Scalability - Manages complex process with minimal oversight
    - Integration - Connects across APIs, databases and systems to break silos
    - Competitive Edge - Transforms experiences and operations for market differentiation
  
## Real world use cases of Agentic AI
  - Finance
    - Automates financial analysis across data sources
    - Conducts risk assessment using diverse inputs
    - Generates compliance reports aligned with regulations
  - Customer Support
    - Resolves issues end-to-end with AI agents
    - Accesses knowledge bases, account data and service tools
  - Procurement
    - Reviews contracts
    - Manages vendors efficiently
    - Optimizes purchases based on factors
  - Business development
    - Qualifies leads end to end
    - Generates proposals automatically
    - Schedules seamlessly with CRM and calenders
  - Healthcare
    - Triages patients efficiently
    - Coordinates with medical systems
    - Schedules and manges software

## Key components of Agentic AI
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Power reasoning, summarization, and knowledge retrieval. 
  - Serve as the cognitive core enabling natural language understanding and decision-making.

- Tool Use and APIs 
  - Connect agents to external systems such as databases, APIs, and applications. 
  - Enable agents to execute actions and perform tasks beyond text generation.

- Reasoning and Planning
 - Allow agents to analyse goals, break them into steps, and decide optimal actions. 
 - Support multi-step task execution and adaptive decision-making.

- Autonomy and Action
  - Empower agents to act independently based on context and objectives. 
  - Facilitate continuous perception–planning–action loops without human intervention.

## What is an agent?
- An agent is someone who can perform a task autonomously
- In Agentic AI, an agent is an autonomous system (or program) that can perceive, 
reason, and act to achieve specific goals — often without constant human intervention.

## Strengths of ChatGPT
- Engages in natural conversational interaction — understands context, tone, and follow-up questions, enabling human-like dialogue.
- Generates, explains, and debugs code across multiple programming languages, supporting both beginners and professionals.
- Integrates with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — can reference external or custom knowledge sources for more accurate and contextual responses.
- Versatile across domains and use cases — applied in education, research, software development, content creation, business analytics, and more.

## Applications of CHATGPT across domains
- Provides learning support and personalized tutoring
- Q/A
- Business
  - Drafts reports
  - Emails
  - Automating customer support
  - Market research etc
- Software development
  - Debug complex issues
  - helps Learn new programming concepts
  - Generates efficient code solutions
- Creative work
  - Creates storytelling ideas
  - Develops design concepts and brainstorm
  - Refines and edits projects

## Coding assistance
- Boilerplate generation
- Code refactoring
- Optimization od computer code

## Essential Skills for Agentic AI

- Python programming skills
- Understanding of LLM Models
- Prompt engineering Basics

# Questions

1. You mentioned that Limitation of Classical AI is needs labelled data, but we can have unsupervised learning, like
business recommendations using tweeter data for a company, or celebrity XX. Please clarify
2. Reference - Slide Agentic AI Property - Adaptive: question: Will agentic AI learn automatically within the same deployment, without being given explicit retaining?
3. Is Narrow AI also called As Weak AI?


As Neeraj Garg mentioned, lets keep the questions as private notes, till the Q/A opens
so we are not distracted by continious chat messages, thank you.

# Constructive Feedback:

1. For better influence of students, avoid reading slides directly. Ps: specially in this group of industry experts.
