## The journey of AI
  - Evolves form a single technology to broad spectrum of capabilities
  - Pattern recognition and decision prediction 

## Classical / Predictive AI (ML) vs. Generative AI vs. Agentic AI

- Classical / Predictive AI (ML)
  - Core capability: Pattern recognition and decision prediction
  - I/O - Historical data -> prediction, classification
  - Examples - Fraud detection, credit scoring, recommendation engines
  - Limitations - Needs labeled data, limited adaptability
- Generative AI
  - Core capability - Generating content (Text, images, code)
  - I/o - Prompt + generated output
  - Human Involvement: Medium, guided by propmts
  - Examples: chatgpt, Stable Diffusion, github copilot
  - Limitations: Prone to hallucinations, lacks reasoning
- Agentic AI
  - Core capability: Autonomous reasoning, planning and action
    - Degree of autonomy may vary
  - I/O: Goal/task -> Multi step execution
  - Human Involvement: Low, makes autonomous decisions
  - Examples: End to end travel booking, automated compliance, workflow orchestration
  - Limitations: Early stage, control and safety is complex

- Significance of Agentic AI
  - Beyond prediction and content
  - Need for autonomy
    - Automates multi-step workflows
    - Enhances decison making with context
  - Bridging gaps
    - Scales operations without proportional staffing
    - Frees humans for creative and strategic work
    
- Definition
  - Agentic AI is an artificial intelligence system that can accomplish a specific goal
with limited supervision. 

- Agentic AI system properties - Advantages
  - Autonomy - acts independently without continous human guidance
  - Goal-oriented - makes informs decisions through reasoning and learning
  - Multi-tool use
  - Adaptive
  - Executes tasks across systems to achieve goals

- Business Relevance of Agentic AI
  - Delivers Transformative Capabilities Across the Enterprise
    - Efficiency - Automates complex, multi step workflows, speeding processes
    - Decision support - adds reasoning and context for better strategic decisions
    - Scalability - Manages complex process with minimal oversight
    - Integration - Connects across APIs, databases and systems to break silos
    - Competitive Edge - Transforms experiences and operations for market differentiation
  
- Real world use cases of Agentic AI
  - Finance
    - Automates financial analysis across data sources
    - Conducts risk assessment using diverse inputs
    - Generates compliance reports aligned with regulations
  - Customer Support
    - Resolves issues end-to-end with AI agents
    - Accesses knowledge bases, account data and service tools
  - Procurment
    - Reviews contracts
    - Manages vendors ewfficiently
    - Optimizes purchaes based on factors
  - Business development
    - Qualifies leads end to end
    - Generates proposals automaticvlaly
    - Schedules deamlessly with CRM and calnders
  - Healthcare
    - Triages patients efficienyly
    - Coordinates with medical systems
    - Schedules and manges softwares

## Key components of Agentic AI
- Large Language Models
  - Enable reasoning, summarization, and knowledge retrival
- Tool use and APIs
  - Connect to extenral systems (Databases, APIs, apps)
  - Executes actions beyond text creation
- Reasoning and planning
  - TODO
- Autonomy and Action
  - TODO

## What is a agent?
- An agent is someone who can perform a task autonomously

## Strengths of ChatGPT
- Enagages in cnversational interaction
- Generates and explains code
- Access to RAG 
- Used in all domains and all purposes

## Applications of CHATGPT across domains
- Provides learning support and personalized tutoring
- Q/A
- Business

# Questions

1. You mentioned that Limitation of Classical AI is needs labelled data, but we can have unsupervised learning, like
business recommendations using tweeter data for a company, or celebrity XX. Please clarify
2. Reference - Slide Agentic AI Property - Adaptive: question: Will agentic AI learn automatically within the same deployment, without being given explicit retaining?
3. Is Narrow AI also called As Weak AI?


As Neeraj Garg mentioned, lets keep the questions as private notes, till the Q/A opens
so we are not distracted by continious chat messages, thank you.

# Constructive Feedback:

1. For better influence of students, avoid reading slides directly. Ps: specially in this group of industry experts.
