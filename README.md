# Agentic Artificial Intelligence and Applications 
This repository is dedicated to building and exploring AI-driven agents and autonomous systems. It includes dynamic learning, hands-on experimentation, and individual development of various agentic AI applications. Each project reflects my goal to innovate, solve real-world problems, and create impactful AI solutions.

As I develop these applications, I'll be continuously discovering new ideas, refining my problem-solving skills, and harnessing the power of AI to create practical, real-world solutions.

Join me on this journey of building cutting-edge Agentic AI systems!

## Projects

Explore the collection of AI agent [projects](https://github.com/AbhishekJunnarkar/Agentic-Artificial-Intelligence-And-Applications-IITM/blob/main/Projects.md) I am working on. These range from basic agentic systems to more advanced, autonomous solutions that integrate large language models, multi-agent systems, and real-time decision-making frameworks.

## Core Design Principles

These principles guide the development of each project:

- Learning by Doing: Each project involves live coding, demos, and hands-on experiments to build tangible AI solutions. Theoretical concepts are introduced only to support practical application.

- Progressive Complexity: Projects evolve from simple AI tasks to more complex ones, including the use of large language models, embeddings, multi-agent systems, and ethical AI considerations.

- Real-World Alignment: Projects mirror real-world challenges to ensure the tools and techniques developed are applicable to practical, industry-relevant problems.

## Learning Outcomes

By engaging with these projects, the following objectives will be achieved:

Understand key concepts in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and agentic systems, including types of agents and relevant frameworks.

Build functional AI agents using tools like LangChain, CrewAI, and Flowise.

Develop skills in prompt engineering and AI interaction, specifically with LLMs.

Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for contextual Q&A and summarization tasks.

Evaluate agent performance using debugging, tracing, and metric-based methods, optimizing for real-world applications.

Incorporate ethical and safety considerations in the development of autonomous agents.

Complete a capstone project creating a fully functional AI agent for a specific use case.

## Tools

Work with industry-standard tools such as Python, Jupyter, LangChain, Flowise, CrewAI, Hugging Face, FAISS, and Pinecone.

## Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence and Agentic Systems are shaping the future, and this repository serves as a platform to build, learn, and contribute to this exciting field. Each project I develop aims to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in real-world applications.
